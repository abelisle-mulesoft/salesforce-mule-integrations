# Salesforce Mule Integrations

This repository contains a collection of Salesforce integration projects implemented using the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform. I have taken the initiative to organize these projects for my personal reference. However, I encourage you to feel free to copy, clone, or fork any of them if you find them useful.

## Projects List



Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC)
